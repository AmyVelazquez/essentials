# Essentials Contact Forms

Above there are 3 different html files each representing a form on the essentials site

- contact.html (https://essentialscontact.centercentre.com/)
- receipt.html (https://essentialscontact.centercentre.com/receipt)
- team.html (https://essentialscontact.centercentre.com/team)

All the forms featured on each route are built using https://formcrafts.com/, login to edit forms

https://essentials.centercentre.com/ (main site) is hosted on Podia, our dns records point to it. The reason why we don't build the forms on this url is we dont have access to the code, Podia handles all of that. There is no option for custom HTML or even a form plugin on podia, so all forms are hosted on our servers found here - https://dopractice.uie.com/smb/web/view
